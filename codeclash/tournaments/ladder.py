"""CC:Ladder tournament orchestration.

Two entry points:
- :func:`build_ladder` — run PvP tournaments across all pairs of players (round-robin) to *build*
  and rank a ladder (``codeclash ladder make``).
- :class:`LadderTournament` — send a single climber up a ranked ladder, rung by rung, until it
  loses (``codeclash ladder run``).

This module owns all ladder business logic; ``codeclash/cli/ladder.py`` is a thin CLI adapter.
Nothing here depends on ``typer``: rule validation raises :class:`ValueError` so the class is usable
outside the CLI, and the CLI translates those into user-facing exits.
